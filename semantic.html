                            Digital art refers to any artistic work or practice that uses digital technology as part of the creative or presentation process. It can also<br> refer to computational art that uses and engages with digital media. Since the 1960s, various names have been used to describe<br> digital art, including computer art, electronic art, multimedia art, and new media art.

                            Subcategories for the art include digital painting, where artists use software to emulate techniques<br> using in physical painting, digital illustration, which involves creating rendered images for other<br> media, and 3D modeling, where artists craft three-dimensional objects and scenes. Pieces of<br>     digital art range from captured in unique displays and restricted from duplication to popular memes available for reproduction<br> in commercial products.

                    <h3><b>About Painting</b></h3>
                    <article>
                        <p>
                            Painting is a visual art, which is characterized by the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or<br> other medium to a solid surface (called the "matrix"or "support").The medium is commonly<br> applied to the base with a brush, but other implements, such as knives, sponges, and airbrushes,<br> may be used. One who produces paintings is called a painter.

                            In art, the term "painting" describes both the act and the result of the action (the final work is called<br> "a painting"). The support for paintings includes such surfaces as walls, paper, canvas, wood,<br> glass, lacquer, pottery, leaf, copper and concrete, and the painting may incorporate multiple other<br> materials, including sand, clay, paper, plaster, gold leaf, and even whole objects.

                            Painting is an important form of visual art, bringing in elements such as drawing, composition,<br> gesture, narration, and abstraction. Paintings can be naturalistic and representational (as in still<br> life and landscape painting), photographic, abstract, narrative, symbolistic (as in Symbolist art),<br> emotive (as in Expressionism) or political in nature (as in Artivism).

                    <h3><b>About Sketching</b></h3>

                        <p>
                            A sketch (ultimately from Greek σχέδιος – schedios, "done extempore") is a rapidly<br> executed freehand drawing that is not usually intended as a finished work. A sketch may<br> serve a number of purposes: it might record something that the artist sees, it might record or<br> develop an idea for later use or it might be used as a quick way of graphically demonstrating<br> an image, idea or principle. Sketching is the most inexpensive art medium.

                            Sketches can be made in any drawing medium. The term is most often applied to graphic<br> work executed in a dry medium such as silverpoint, graphite, pencil, charcoal or pastel. It may<br> also apply to drawings executed in pen and ink, digital input such as a digital pen, ballpoint<br> pen, marker pen, water colour and oil paint. The latter two are generally referred to as "water<br> colour sketches" and "oil sketches". A sculptor might model three-dimensional sketches in<br> clay, plasticine or wax.
